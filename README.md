# Dad-Jokes App!
 **API available from [ICanHazDadJoke.com](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/)**

 ## Why?

 I am a recent software bootcamp grad looking to sharpen my teeth a bit on some new projects. This is a project very inline with my humor, and also allowed for very easy API integration allowing me to focus on the front end.

### What was learned:
###### CSS Animations
  This was a first real stab into CSS animations. While there is nothing ground-breaking here, I think the subtle animations I did include help the app feel fluid and easily navigatable.
###### Mobile adaptability
  Thumb-Fu my friends!!! Utilizing some of the @media functionality within my CSS, I was able to make sure that all clickable options within the app (though to be fair, there aren't many) are within thumb access for right handers.

  **Future Iteration Concept** => the addition of a 'Left or Right handed' option may be a nice additional touch. this would swap my 'close' and 'get joke' buttons to the left side of the screen rather than the righ, thus allowing for left handed users to more easily engage with these functions.
###### Funciton calling time management
  While in general this was a very easy build, one of the few struggles I did run into was with time management in my functions. To get the smooth fade-ins and fade-outs, I needed to leverage multiple divs and sections to make sure fades happened prior to content updates. While I believe there are much better applications of this, I think my solution of utilizing a simple if else statement was a nice solution.

### Future Plans!

  - [ ] Home Grown api to allow for login and 'favorite' functionality
  - [ ] Social links to post jokes to facebook, instangram, etc.
  - [ ] Left vs. Right hand components.
  - [ ] Filter to make sure only new jokes are served while in a single session (currently, randomized from api which can include repeat content.)
  - [ ] Submit new joke feature to intigrate directly to api creators at 'ICanHazDadJoke.com'.
